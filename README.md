# Front-End Boilerplate

This is the front-end boilerplate that we use at
[KPS3](http://kps3.com/).

More details on how it works and the backstory can be found at: http://kps3.com/our-front-end-development-boilerplate/

## Requirements

You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) installed.

## Getting Started

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kps3/kps3.boilerplate.git
$ cd kps3.boilerplate
$ npm install
```

## Usage

The following commands are available:

- `grunt` to build the project
- `grunt watch` to watch files for changes and automatically rebuild the project
